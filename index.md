This blog documents my journey into machine learning as a Biology and Neuroscience student with a foundational background in computer science. 

Before starting this journey, I completed introductory Python and Java courses, alongside a computational neuroscience course at my university. Through these courses, I became familiar with the majority of the programming concepts detailed in "Building Python Programs" by Stuart Reges, Marty Stepp, and Allison Obourn.

In the three weeks leading up to the start of this blog, I dedicated my time to studying the following materials:

  1. Coursera lectures on "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" and "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization," both taught by Andrew Ng.

  3. The first chapter of "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen, to the extent that I could personally visualize and explain every segment of the code for the digit identifier.

  5. The two 3Blue1Brown YouTube series on the essence of linear algebra and neural networks.

  7. The first two lectures by Jeremy Howard on the fast.ai website and the initial one and a half chapters of "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch AI Applications Without a PhD" by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger.

The impetus to start this blog came from the second chapter of "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch AI Applications Without a PhD," which prompted me to share my thoughts and experiences as I delve deeper into the field of machine learning. The template for this blog was also provided by fast.ai. 

## Thank you fast.ai!
